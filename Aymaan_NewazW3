This week we were mainly focused on finalizing a project idea and getting ready with a brief project outline.
We found out that our first idea was not very feasible so we brainstormed as a group and landed on our newest idea, the "Automated Door".
I started working on the project outline in order to prepare for the coming class where we peer review ideas with other groups
