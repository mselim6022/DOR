In this week me and the rest of the team brainstormed 
individually and as a group to finalize our project idea

I reached a mental blockade when it came to ideas for the project. 
I decided to get a second opinion and my Mom provided me with a really good idea 
which is a device that turns a normal door into an Automatic door with app control.

I presented the idea to my teammates and 
we noted down a couple of solutions to problems such as:

How will the door open after being closed?
We figured a rubberized string on the doorknob will have enough grip to turn the doorknob

What components would we need?
A simple servo motor, a string, a light sensor should be enough (subject to change)

In conclusion we will be going forward with 
the automatic doors idea and work on building it.
