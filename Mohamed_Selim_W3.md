## This is the weekly report for week 3.

# Summary of what the team did: 
This week we were mainly focused on finalizing a project idea and getting ready with a brief project outline.
We found out that our first idea was not very feasible so we brainstormed as a group and landed on our newest idea, the "Automated Door".
I started research to determine if any extra equipment will be needed to accomplish this project idea.
