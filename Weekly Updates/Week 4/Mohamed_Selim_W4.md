# Week 4 Update:
This week, we focused on drafting a proposal, receiving feedback from peers, and then using that feedback to finalize our proposal.
Each of the members also individually reviewed and gave feedback on at least 2 draft proposals by other teams.

## Key points of feedback received:
- Include more information in milestone descriptions
- Improve the UML Diagram
- Be more specific in milestones, rather than generalizing
