1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
I spent 5 hours on the project this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Top item: Research, 2 hours
   2. 2nd item: Meetings, 1 hour
   3. 3rd item: Preparing testing, 1 hour
   4. 4th item: Hardware implementation, 1 hour
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Our team designed a new approach for the mechanical components of the system. I got jumper wires from the TAs during the lab session, and reached out to tech services to try and borrow a Kuman Kit.
  - In our team meeting, we discussed our Unit Testing Plan and are mostly done.
  - Our team completed the ITP metrics questionnaire. I reviewed my ratings for myself compared to my teammates rating for my performance.
  - I ordered an H-bridge (L298N) online to help control the direction and speed of the motor's rotation.
  - Started looking into designing a doorknob extender handle to reduce force required by the motor.
  - I watched two videos of the provided examples of individual tech memos to plan for mine.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I feel optimistic. The knowledge I obtained from researching the mechanical components is finally falling into place. The results of the ITP metrics show that our team has great communication and is progressing as intended.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Complete my Tech Memo.
  - Complete the project unit testing plan with my team.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - All of our team members have a midterm this week that is delaying our work on the unit test plan. I need my teammates to plan ahead and organize their time so that we have enuogh time to work on the unit test plan together.
